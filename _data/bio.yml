  content:  "I am a first-year PH.D. student majoring in Computer Vision at 
          <strong>Huazhong University of Science and Technology</strong>, supervised 
          by <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/changxingao/'>A.P. Changxin Gao</a>
          and <a href='http://auto.hust.edu.cn/info/1154/3414.htm'>Prof. Nong Sang</a>.
          I received the China National Scholarship in 2018. Before that, I received 
          my B.S. degree from Shandong University in 2016.<br><br>

          I was a visiting student at the <strong>Statistical Machine Learning Group</strong> 
          of the <strong>University of Adelaide</strong>, supervised by
          <a href='https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~chhshen/'>Prof. Chunhua Shen</a>.
          Before that, I was a research intern at <strong>Megvii (Face++) Inc.</strong> 
          mentored by <a href='http://www.skicyyu.org/'>Dr Gang Yu</a> and 
          supervised by <a href='http://www.jiansun.org/'>Dr Jian Sun</a>.<br><br>

          My research interests focus on <strong>Computer Vision</strong> and 
          <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, specifically on the topic
